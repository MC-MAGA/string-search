        <h3>Goals and Scope</h3>
        <p>This document describes the problems, requirements, and considerations for specification or implementations of string searching operations. A common example of string searching is the "find" command in a Web browser, but there are many other forms of searching that a specification might wish to define. </p>
        
        <p class="note">This document builds on <cite>Character Model for the World Wide Web: Fundamentals</cite> [[CHARMOD]] and <cite>Character Model for the Word Wide Web: String Matching</cite> [[CHARMOD-NORM]]. Understanding the concepts in those documents are important to being able to understand and apply this document successfully.</p>
        
        <p>The main target audience of this specification is W3C specification developers who need to define some form of search or find algorithm: the goal is to provide a stable reference to the concepts, terms, and requirements needed.</p>
        
        <p>The concepts described in this document provide authors of specifications, software developers, and content developers with a common reference for consistent, interoperable text searching on the World Wide Web. Working together, these three groups can build a globally accessible Web.</p>
        
        <p>This document contains best practices and requirements for other specifications, as well as recommendations for implementations and content authors. These best practices for specifications (and others) can also be found in the Internationalization Working Group's document <cite>[[INTERNATIONAL-SPECS]]</cite>, which is intended to serve as a general reference for all Internationalization best practices in W3C specifications.</p>

        <h3>Background</h3>
        <p>At the core of the character model is the Universal Character Set (UCS), defined jointly by the <cite>Unicode Standard</cite> [[Unicode]] and ISO/IEC 10646 [[ISO10646]]. In this document, <dfn>Unicode</dfn> is used as a synonym for the Universal Character Set. A successful character model allows Web documents authored in the world's writing systems, scripts, and languages (and on different platforms) to be exchanged, read, and searched by the Web's users around the world.</p>
        
        <p>The first few chapters of the <cite>Unicode Standard</cite> [[Unicode]] provide useful background reading. In addition, the <cite>Unicode Collation Algorithm</cite> [[UTS10]] contains a chapter on searching.</p>

      <p>Many Web implementations and applications have a need for users or 
	  programs to search documents for particular words or phrases of natural 
	  language text. This is different from the sorts of programmatic matching 
	  needed by formal languages (such as markup languages such as [[HTML]]; 
	  style sheets [[CSS21]]; or data formats such as [[TURTLE]] or [[JSON-LD]]). </p>
      <p>There are many types of string searching. The form of string searching 
	  which we'll concern ourselves with here is sub-string matching or "find" 
	  operations. This is the direct searching of the body or "corpus" of a 
	  document with the user's input. Find operations can have different options 
	  or implementation details, such as the addition or removal of case 
	  sensitivity, or whether the feature supports different aspects of a 
	  regular expression language or "wildcards".</p>
      <p>A different type of string searching, <strong>which is outside the 
	  scope of this document</strong>, is <dfn>Full Text Search</dfn>. When you 
	  are using a search engine, you are generally using a form of full text 
	  search. Full text search generally breaks natural language text into word 
	  segments and may apply complex processing to get at the semantic "root" 
	  values of words. For example, if the user searches for "run", you might 
	  want to find words like "running", "ran", or "runs" in addition to the 
	  actual search term "run". This process, naturally, is sensitive to 
	  language, context, and many other aspects of textual variation. </p>
	  
	  <section id="otherEquivalences">
         <h3>Other Types of Equivalence</h3>
         
         <p>In addition to the forms of character equivalence described in [[CHARMOD-NORM]], there are other types of equivalence that are interesting when performing string searching. The forms of equivalence found in the String Matching document are all based on character properties assigned by Unicode or due to the mapping of  legacy character encodings to the Unicode character set. The "interesting equivalences" in this section that are outside of those defined by Unicode.</p>

		 
		 <p>For example, Japanese uses two syllabic scripts,
		 <code>hiragana</code> and <code>katakana</code>. A 
		 user searching a document might type in text in one script, but wish to find 
		 equivalent text in both scripts. These additional "text 
		 normalizations" are sometimes application, natural language, or domain 
		 specific and shouldn't be overlooked by specifications or 
		 implementations as an additional consideration.</p>
		 <p>Another similar example is called <dfn>digit shaping</dfn>. Some scripts,
		 such as Arabic or Thai, have their own digit characters for the numbers from 0 to 9.
		 In some Web applications, the familiar ASCII digits are replaced for display
		 purposes with the local digit shapes. In other cases, the text actually might
		 contain the Unicode characters for the local digits. Users attempting to search
		 a document might expect that typing one form of digit will find the eqivalent
		 digits.</p>
		 <aside class="example" title="Examples of digit shapes in four scripts">
		 <p>Here are some selected examples of different digit shapes, from zero to nine, in four scripts. Many scripts have equivalent sets of digits with distinct shapes.</p>

        <h2>Considerations for Searching</h2>
        <p class="issue">This section was identified as a new area needing 
		document as part of the overall rearchitecting of the document. The text 
		here is incomplete and needs further development. Contributions from the 
		community are invited.</p>
		  <p>Implementers often need to provide simple "find text" algorithms 
		  and specifications often try to define APIs to support these needs. 
		  Find operations on text generate different user expectations and thus 
		  have different requirements from the need for absolute identity 
		  matching needed by document formats and protocols. It is important to 
		  note that domain-specific requirements may impose additional 
		  restrictions or alter the considerations presented here.</p>
		  <section id="UserInput">
		  <h3>Variations in User Input</h3>
        <p>One of the primary considerations for string searching is that, quite 
		often, the user's input is not identical to the way that the text being 
		searched is 
		encoded. </p>
			  <p>One primary reason this happens is because the text 
		can vary in ways the user cannot predict. In other cases it is because the user's keyboard 
		or input method does not provide ready access to the textual variations 
		needed&mdash;or because the user cannot be bothered to input the text accurately. For example,
		users often omit accents when entering Latin-script languages, particularly on mobile keyboards, even though the text they
		are searching includes the accents. In these cases, users generally expect the search operation to be more 
		"promiscuous" to make up for the failure to add additional effort to 
		their input. </p>
		  <p>For example, a user might expect a term entered in lowercase to 
		  match uppercase equivalents. Conversely, when the user expends more 
		  effort on the input&mdash;by using the shift key to produce uppercase or 
		  by entering a letter with diacritics instead of just the base 
		  letter&mdash;they might expect their search results to match (only) their 
		  more-specific input.</p>
		  <p>A different case is where the text can vary in multiple ways, but 
		  the user can only type a single search term in. For example, the 
		  Japanese language uses two different phonetic scripts, <em>hiragana</em> 
		  and <em>katakana</em>. These scripts encode the same phonemes; thus 
		  the user might expect that typing in a search term in <em>hiragana</em> 
		  would find the exact same word spelled out in <em>katakana</em>. </p>
			  <p>A 
		  different example might be the presence or absence of short vowels in 
		  the Arabic and Hebrew scripts. For most languages in these scripts, 
		  the inclusion of the short vowels is entirely optional, but the 
		  presence of vowels in text being searched might impede a match if the 
		  user doesn't enter or know to enter them.</p>
        <p>This effect might vary depending on context as well. For example, a 
		person using a physical keyboard may have direct access to accented 
		letters, while a virtual or on-screen keyboard may require extra effort 
		to access and select the same letters.</p>
        <p>Consider a document containing these strings: "re-resume", 
		"RE-RESUME", "re-r&#xe9;sum&#xe9;", and "RE-R&#xc9;SUM&#xc9;".</p>
        <p>In the table below, the user's input (on the left) might be 
		considered a match for the above items as follows:</p>
        <table class="data">
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <th scope="col">User Input</th>
              <th scope="col">Matched Strings</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>e (lowercase 'e')</td>
              <td>"re-resume", "RE-RESUME", "re-r&#xe9;sum&#xe9;", and "RE-R&#xC9;SUM&#xc9;"</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>E (uppercase 'E')</td>
              <td>"RE-RESUME" and "RE-R&#xc9;SUM&#xc9;"</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>&#xe9; (lowercase 'e' with acute accent)</td>
              <td>"re-r&#xe9;sum&#xe9;" and "RE-R&#xc9;SUM&#xc9;"</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>&#xc9; (uppercase 'E' with acute accent)</td>
              <td>"RE-R&#xc9;SUM&#xc9;"</td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>
        <p>In addition to variations of case or the use of accents, Unicode also 
		has an array of canonical equivalents or compatibility characters (as 
		described in the sections above) that might impact string searching.</p>
        <p>For example, consider the letter "K". Characters with a compatibility 
		mapping to <code>U+004B LATIN CAPITAL LETTER K</code> include:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>&#x136; U+0136</li>

		  U+1D40A,U+1D43E,U+1D472,U+1D4A6,U+1D4DA)</li>
          <li>&#x1f11a; U+1F11A</li>
          <li>&#x1f13a; U+1F13A.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Other differences include Unicode Normalization forms (or lack 
		thereof). There are also ignorable characters (such as the variation 
		selectors), whitespace differences, bidirectional controls, and other 
		code points that can interfere with a match. </p>
        <p>Users might also expect certain kinds of equivalence to be applied to 
		matching. For example, a Japanese user might expect that hiragana, 
		katakana, and half-width compatibility katakana equivalents all match 
		each other (regardless of which is used to perform the selection or 
		encoded in the text). </p>
        <p>When searching text, the concept of "grapheme boundaries" and 
		"user-perceived characters" can be important. See Section 3 of <cite>
		Character Model for the World Wide Web: Fundamentals</cite> [[CHARMOD]] 
		for a description. For example, if the user has entered a capital "A" 
		into a search box, should the software find the character &#xc0; 
		(<span class="uname" translate="no">U+00C0 LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A WITH ACCENT GRAVE</span>)? 
		What about the character "A" followed by U+0300 (a combining accent 
		grave)? What about writing systems, such as Devanagari, which use 
		combining marks to suppress or express certain vowels?</p>

      <h3>Types of Search Option</h3>
      <p>When creating a string search API or algorithm, the following textual options might be useful to users:</p>
      <ul>
         <li>Case-sensitive vs. case-insensitive</li>
         <li>Kana folding</li>
         <li>Unicode normalization form</li>
         <li>etc.</li>
